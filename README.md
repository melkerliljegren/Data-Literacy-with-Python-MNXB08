The course provides the student with fundamental skills in data handling using Python.
The focus is on exploratory data analysis, leveraging visualizations and data summaries to extract insights from datasets. Additionally, the course covers data cleaning, transformations, and merging data from multiple sources.

These competences are developed through the hands-on development of data analysis scripts in an interactive environment. The course emphasizes literate programming, which teaches the student about reproducibility and highlights the importance of well-documented data analysis that can be shared with others.

At the end of the course, the student develop a deeper understanding of virtual environments in Python and the concept of reproducibility. This enhances the reliability of conclusions drawn from data analysis.
